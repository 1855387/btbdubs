## Project Description + Ideas
- Login Pages
- Authenticated Pages (only certain people can access)
- Roles (different access hierarchy)
- Database with users
- API (is this how other people can use our database?)


### Project Owner Requirements
- Site with login system connected to a database, usable by others through an API
- Permissions attached to accounts, allowing access to different actions and pages
- Explanation of how to create a permission system to aid others in creating similar systems

### Objectives before N@TM
- Complete login system with database
  - Accessible by others for their projects
  - Complete ASAP
- Guide to creating authentication system
  - Allows others to create their own systems
- Multiple pages, with premissions integrated
  - Demonstrates our work with security
  - Page to update users with roles

### Objectives and Requirements

If we're able to complete all of the listed objectives, then in addition to a live presentation (Tuesday), we'll have fulfilled all of the requirements of our sponsor. The login system & database will connect to our authentication/security system, and then we'll be able to teach others how to create their own systems through the live presentation and instruction on the site.
